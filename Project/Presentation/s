Title: Improving Customer Support Efficiency using Classic ML
Subtitle: Proposal for the Hackathon Solution

Introduction:
- Hackathon problem: Improving customer support efficiency
- Solution approach: Utilizing classic machine learning techniques 
- Targeted sector: E-commerce industry

Problem Statement:
- Inefficient customer support leads to longer response times, dissatisfied customers, and increased customer churn
- Current customer support systems lack intelligent automation, leading to repetitive and unnecessary human intervention

Solution Overview:
- Our proposed solution leverages classic machine learning algorithms to automate and enhance customer support processes
- Key components:
  1. Text classification for automated ticket routing
  2. Sentiment analysis for customer sentiment tracking
  3. Chatbot for instant response and basic issue resolution

Data Collection:
- Gather historical customer support interactions
- Include ticket subject, description, assigned category, and customer satisfaction ratings
- Utilize a combination of free e-commerce datasets, customer conversations, or labeled data from previous customer support interactions

Data Preprocessing:
- Clean the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and perform stemming or lemmatization
- Tokenize the text data into individual words
- Convert text data to numerical representation using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings

Text Classification:
- Train a supervised machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) using the preprocessed data
- Perform multi-class classification to assign ticket categories automatically
- Improve accuracy over time with feedback loops and active learning

Sentiment Analysis:
- Use supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Transform the customer satisfaction ratings into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment labels
- Identify potential issues and track trends in customer satisfaction

Chatbot Implementation:
- Implement a rule-based or generative chatbot using frameworks like Dialogflow or Rasa
- Train the chatbot on historical support ticket conversations
- Handle common customer support queries, provide instant responses, and resolve basic issues

Model Deployment and Feedback Loop:
- Deploy the ML models in the customer support system infrastructure
- Continuously monitor and collect feedback on model performance
- Improve the models by incorporating user feedback and by updating training on new data regularly

Benefits and Future Scope:
- Reduction in customer response time
- Automation of repetitive support tasks
- Better tracking of customer sentiment and satisfaction levels
- Potential integration with voice assistants or specialized chat platforms
- Smart routing and automated escalation of complex or urgent tickets

Conclusion:
- Classic ML models offer powerful mechanisms to enhance customer support efficiency
- Our proposed solution, incorporating text classification, sentiment analysis, and chatbot, can transform customer support processes in the e-commerce industry
